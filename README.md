## Overview

This Yunohost Package will help you deploy an Earthstar server on your own server. The server
will run on the Node.js runtime.

If you'd like to further customise your server, you can learn more about servers
and their extensions at the
[main Earthstar repo](https://github.com/earthstar-project/earthstar/blob/main/README_SERVERS.md).

### Features

- Syncs your Earthstar Project shares and keeps a copy of the data on your own server


**Shipped version:** 1.0~ynh1

**Demo:** https://earthstar-project.org

## Disclaimers / important information

* First time I am trying to make an Yunohost application
* Any known limitations, constrains or stuff not working, such as (but not limited to):
    * requiring a full dedicated domain ?
    * architectures not supported ?
    * not-working single-sign on or LDAP integration ?
    * the app requires an important amount of RAM / disk / .. to install or to work properly
    * etc...

* Create a new file called `known_shares.json` in the root of this project. Add
   the public addresses of the shares you'd like your server to replicate as an
   array of strings (e.g. `["+one.xxx", "two.xxx"]`).
