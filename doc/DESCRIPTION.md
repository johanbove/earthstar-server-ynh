This application lets you run and configure an Earthstar Server capable of syncing with other peers.

The server will run on the Node.js runtime.

If you'd like to further customise your server, you can learn more about servers
and their extensions at the
[main Earthstar repo](https://github.com/earthstar-project/earthstar/blob/main/README_SERVERS.md).
